### Installation:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/neXromancers/hacksaw`

(crates.io coming soon)

### Features:
- **Guide Lines** to check precise positions and line up before you start a selection
  - just like the popular [Guides](https://github.com/udf/slop-guides) shader for slop
- doesn't instantly quit on first keypress
  - keep typing like a pro while you screenshot your memes
  - *(tiling wm exclusive)* you can still navigate windows while in hacksaw
- select with any mouse button, not just left click!
  - except right click, that's cancel
  - restart selection by scrolling scrollwheel
- you can customise the *colour* and **width** of the lines
  - and you can customise the width of selection and guide lines **separately**!
- did i mention it's written in **RUST**
- *lightweight and fast*
  - not that i've actually run any performance comparisons to slop
- [one of Thor's favorites](https://xkcd.com/2097/)
- built for the most *advanced* and *cutting edge* platform of today, ***X11***
